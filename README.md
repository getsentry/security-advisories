# Sentry Security Advisories
The intent of this public repo is to store security vulnerability advisories made by Sentry in a centralized location. 

Advisories are stored as Issues, and will contain a description, impact, patches, any workaround(s), a CVSS 3.1 score and vector, and any additional information such as links to blog posts, NIST reference pages for the CVE, etc.
