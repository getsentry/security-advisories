# Sentry Security Advisories
The intent of this public repo is to store security vulnerability advisories made by Sentry in a centralized location. Advisories are stored as Issues, and will contain a description, impact, any workaround(s), a CVSS 3.1 score and vector, and any additional information such as link to blog posts, etc.
